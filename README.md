A submission for Hack The Burgh 2021's Optiver Challenge! More to come.

The Optiver Challenge required us to use the Cloud9 service, so there wasn't a need for version control - this was auto-saved and we had to use their platform to access the Optiver trading environment.

The challenge basically used a 60-second moving average to inform trading decisions.

Owing to advice sent by HackTheBurgh, we can't actually send the code here. However, feel free to check out our DevPost submission here: https://devpost.com/software/331364
