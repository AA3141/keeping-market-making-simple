A submission for Hack The Burgh 2021's Optiver Challenge! More to come.

The Optiver Challenge required us to use the Cloud9 service, so there wasn't a need for version control - this was auto-saved and we had to use their platform to access the Optiver trading environment.

Owing to advice sent by HackTheBurgh, we can't actually send the code here. However, feel free to check out our DevPost submission here: (TBD)
